# Project-specific notebooks

This directory provides notebooks that were used in specific projects, but whose code did not end up in the in-silico framework. Often, it is still useful to keep a copy of old code that was used to generate specific data, visualisations etc. This directory is then the catalog of code that was worth saving, but too ungeneralisable to implement in ISF.
