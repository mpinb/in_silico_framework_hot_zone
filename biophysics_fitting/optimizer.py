"""Multi-objective optimization algorithm.

This code has been adapted from [BluePyOpt](https://github.com/BlueBrain/BluePyOpt) :cite:`Van_Geit_Gevaert_Chindemi_Roessert_Courcol_Muller_Schuermann_Segev_Markram_2016`
such that:

- a start population can be defined.
- such that the optimizations can be organized in a data base.
- to be executed on a distributed system using dask.
- to return all objectives, not only the combined ones.

The main interface is the function :py:meth:`start_run`.

            This allows, that e.g. the Simular can depend on the data_base. Therefore it is e.g. possible, 
            that the path to the morphology is not saved as absolute path. Instead, fixed parameters can be
            updated accordingly.
            
        n (int): a seedpoint for the optimization randomization.
        pop (list of deap.Individuals | None): The previous population if the optimization is continued. None if a new optimization is started.
        client (distributed.Client | None): A distributed client. If None, the optimization is run on the local machine.
        continue_cp (bool): If True, the optimization is continued. If False, a new optimization is started.
        offspring_size (int): The number of individuals in the offspring.
        eta (int): The number of parents selected for each offspring.
        mutpb (float): The mutation probability.
        cxpb (float): The crossover probability.
        max_ngen (int): The maximum number of generations.
        satisfactory_boundary_dict (dict | None): A dictionary with the boundaries for the objectives. If a model is found, that has all objectives below the boundary, the optimization is stopped.

    # CAVE! get_mymap is doing more, than just to return a map function.
    # - the map function ignores the first argument.
    #   The first argument (i.e. the function to be mapped on the iterable) is ignored.
    #   Instead, that function is hardcoded. It is defined in db_setup['get_Evaluator']
    #   This was neccessary, as my_ibea_evaluator and the deap individuals were causing pickle errors
    # - mymap also saves the features. As the bluepyopt optimizer only sees the sumarized
    #   features (maximum of several individual features, see Hay et. al.), mymap is the ideal
    #   place to insert a routine that saves all features before they get sumarized.
    # - mymap also creates a sub db in db_setup. The name of the sub_db is specified by n: It is str(n)
    #   db_setup[str(n)] then contains all the saved results
